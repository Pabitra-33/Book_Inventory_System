The Inventory Management system is used to manage store products and keep track of all goods stock and also we can use it to check the purchases history of the store.Basically, we are developing a system to manage/automate some processes of any retail store by using the computer. So by using this system we can keep record data of products and even all purchases happened in-store.
So here we are going to develop an inventory management system using python and for storing data we are going to append data files manually from the user. First of all, we will create sample data by using python code itself and then developing all functions one by one.
